## Business Problem


Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Business Understanding

In order to guide the decision-making process for Microsoft's new movie studio, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current trends and successes in the film industry. One key aspect involves examining the types of films that have been performing exceptionally well at the box office. This entails studying recent blockbuster releases, assessing their genres, themes, and audience demographics, and identifying patterns that correlate with high financial returns. Additionally, it is essential to delve into the evolving preferences of global audiences, considering factors such as cultural diversity, emerging storytelling techniques, and the impact of digital platforms on viewership patterns.

Furthermore, a thorough examination of the competitive landscape is crucial to position Microsoft's movie studio strategically. This involves evaluating the strategies employed by other major players in the entertainment industry who have successfully ventured into original content creation. Analyzing the marketing and distribution approaches, as well as the critical and audience reception of recent blockbuster films from rival studios, will provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the market. The goal of this project is to distill these findings into actionable insights that will enable Microsoft's movie studio to make informed decisions about the type of films to produce, ensuring alignment with current market trends, audience preferences, and industry competition.
